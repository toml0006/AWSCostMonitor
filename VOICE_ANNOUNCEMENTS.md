## Integration with Claude

When using Claude Code with this project, task completions will automatically trigger voice announcements if the hooks are properly configured.

## Troubleshooting

If announcements aren't working:

1. Check that scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
   chmod +x announce-completion.sh
   ```

2. Test the voice system:
   ```bash
   say -v Samantha "Testing AWS Cost Monitor announcements"
   ```

3. Check the log file:
   ```bash
   tail ~/.claude/awscostmonitor-announcements.log
   ```

## Privacy

All announcement logs are stored locally on your machine and are never committed to the repository.
