> Spec: Remove IAP and Transition to Paid App Store Model
> Created: 2025-08-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transition AWSCostMonitor from a freemium model with In-App Purchases (IAP) to a simple paid App Store application. This change simplifies the monetization model, removes complex IAP infrastructure, and provides a cleaner user experience with a single upfront purchase.

The current roadmap includes Phase 5 (Monetization & Licensing) with trial systems and license key validation. This spec represents a strategic pivot to leverage Apple's App Store purchase model instead of custom licensing infrastructure.

## User Stories

**As a potential customer**, I want to see the full value of AWSCostMonitor upfront so I can make an informed purchase decision without navigating trial limitations or upgrade prompts.

**As an existing user**, I want a seamless transition that preserves all my current functionality without requiring additional purchases or account migrations.

**As a developer**, I want to simplify the monetization codebase by removing trial logic, license validation, and feature gating complexity.

**As a business owner**, I want to reduce development overhead by eliminating custom licensing infrastructure while maintaining revenue through App Store sales.

## Spec Scope

### Core Changes

- **Remove IAP Infrastructure**: Eliminate all In-App Purchase related code, entitlements, and App Store Connect IAP configurations
- **Remove Trial System**: Delete 14-day trial logic, countdown timers, and trial reminder notifications
- **Remove License Validation**: Eliminate license key systems, cryptographic validation, and Keychain storage for licenses
- **Remove Feature Gating**: Make all current "Pro" features available to all users without restrictions
- **Update App Store Listing**: Transition from freemium to paid app model with clear feature description
- **Pricing Strategy**: Set appropriate paid app price point based on current Pro tier value ($3.99)

### Feature Unification

- **Multi-Profile Support**: Available to all users (previously Pro)
- **Smart Refresh & Budgets**: Available to all users (previously Pro)  
- **Cost Forecasting & Trends**: Available to all users (previously Pro)
- **Service Breakdown & Analytics**: Available to all users (previously Pro)
- **Export Functionality**: Available to all users (previously Pro)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Available to all users (previously Pro)
- **Custom Display Formats**: Available to all users (previously Pro)

## Out of Scope

- **Refunding Existing Customers**: Outside the scope of this technical implementation
- **Marketing Strategy Changes**: Communication and positioning updates handled separately
- **App Store Review Process**: Submission and approval handled as operational task
- **Alternative Monetization Models**: No exploration of subscription or other models
- **Feature Additions**: Focus purely on removing monetization complexity, not adding features

## Expected Deliverable

A simplified AWSCostMonitor application where:

1. **All features are unlocked** for all users without restrictions
2. **No IAP-related code or UI** remains in the codebase
3. **App Store listing** reflects paid app model with clear feature overview
4. **Clean codebase** with reduced complexity from removed monetization infrastructure
5. **Preserved user experience** for existing functionality without trial limitations

The app will be positioned as a premium AWS cost monitoring tool with full feature access included in the purchase price.
