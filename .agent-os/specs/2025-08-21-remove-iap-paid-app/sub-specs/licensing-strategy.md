# Licensing and Distribution Strategy

## Overview
Transition AWSCostMonitor from a freemium In-App Purchase model to a straightforward paid application on the macOS App Store.

## Pricing Strategy
- **Price Point**: $29 one-time purchase
- **Rationale**: 
  - Reflects full feature set previously gated behind Pro tier
  - Competitive with similar AWS cost monitoring tools
  - One-time purchase reduces ongoing maintenance complexity

## Feature Inclusion
All features previously locked behind the Pro tier are now standard:
- Unlimited AWS profiles
- Team cache functionality
- Advanced cost forecasting
- Service breakdown analytics
- Custom display formats
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Export functionality

## Distribution Channels
- **Primary**: macOS App Store
- **Alternative**: 
  - GitHub Releases for manual installation
  - Website download with manual installation instructions

## Licensing Mechanism
- Rely on App Store's built-in purchase and licensing system
- No custom license key infrastructure required
- App unlocks full functionality upon successful App Store purchase

## Existing User Transition
- All existing users automatically receive full feature set
- No additional purchase or migration required
- Maintain existing application data and settings

## Open Source Considerations
- Open source version maintains all features
- Team caching remains available in open source build
- No artificial feature limitations

## Marketing Positioning
- "Professional AWS Cost Monitoring, Zero Complexity"
- Emphasize one-time purchase vs. monthly subscriptions
- Highlight time and cost savings for developers and teams

## Future Considerations
- Potential volume licensing for teams
- Consider upgrade pricing for future major versions
