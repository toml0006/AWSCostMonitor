# Team Cache Integration - Lite Summary

Implement team-shared cost caching via Amazon S3 to reduce redundant AWS Cost Explorer API calls by 5-10x across team members. The feature uses cooperative client-side policy enforcement with 6-hour auto-refresh intervals, 30-minute manual cooldowns, and optimistic concurrency control via ETags. Teams share cost snapshots through a configurable S3 bucket while maintaining the app's privacy-first architecture by leveraging existing AWS credentials.

## Key Points
- Reduce team API costs by 5-10x through intelligent cache sharing
- Maintain privacy-first design using existing AWS credentials and S3 infrastructure
- Implement cooperative refresh policies with graceful fallback to individual operation
