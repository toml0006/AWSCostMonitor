### Integration Tests

**S3 Integration**
- Test end-to-end cache storage and retrieval with real S3 service
- Test IAM permission validation and error messages
- Test cross-region cache access
- Test cache operations with compressed data
- Test bucket lifecycle and cleanup operations

**Cost Explorer Integration**
- Test full data flow: remote cache miss → AWS API → cache storage
- Test cache hit scenario with stale local cache
- Test API rate limiting with team cache enabled
- Test data consistency between cached and fresh API responses

**Configuration Integration**
- Test settings UI updates with team cache options
- Test profile-specific team cache enable/disable
- Test S3 configuration validation in real-time
- Test configuration persistence across app restarts

### Feature Tests

**Team Cache Workflow**
- **Scenario:** First team member fetches fresh data and populates cache
  - Given: Empty remote cache for account/month
  - When: User refreshes cost data
  - Then: Data fetched from AWS API and stored in both local and remote cache

- **Scenario:** Second team member benefits from cached data
  - Given: Fresh data in remote cache from previous team member
  - When: Different user requests same cost data
  - Then: Data retrieved from remote cache without AWS API call

- **Scenario:** Profile-specific team cache configuration
  - Given: User has multiple AWS profiles
  - When: User enables team cache for work profile but not personal profile
  - Then: Only work profile data is shared via remote cache

- **Scenario:** Remote cache unavailable fallback
  - Given: S3 service is unavailable or bucket inaccessible
  - When: User requests cost data
  - Then: App gracefully falls back to direct AWS API call with clear status indication

**Configuration and Setup**
- **Scenario:** Team cache initial setup
  - Given: New user wants to configure team caching
  - When: User follows setup documentation
  - Then: S3 bucket is configured and team cache is operational

- **Scenario:** Invalid S3 configuration handling
  - Given: User enters non-existent bucket name
  - When: App attempts to access remote cache
  - Then: Clear error message displayed with troubleshooting steps

- **Scenario:** Permission denied handling
  - Given: User's IAM role lacks S3 permissions
  - When: App attempts to read/write cache
  - Then: Detailed error with required IAM policy shown

**Cache Invalidation and TTL**
- **Scenario:** Expired cache handling
  - Given: Remote cache contains data older than TTL
  - When: User requests cost data
  - Then: Fresh data fetched from AWS API and cache updated

- **Scenario:** Manual cache bypass
  - Given: User wants to force refresh despite valid cache
  - When: User triggers manual refresh
  - Then: AWS API called directly and cache updated with fresh data

- Mock cache timestamps for expiration testing
- Mock system clock changes for cache validation

**UserDefaults/Configuration Mock**
- Mock profile configuration persistence
- Mock team cache settings storage
- Mock configuration migration scenarios
