> Spec: Team Remote Cache
> Created: 2025-08-11
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a team-based remote caching system that allows multiple AWSCostMonitor users to share cost data through a secure cloud-based cache, reducing redundant AWS Cost Explorer API calls and associated costs while maintaining the privacy-first approach of the application.

## User Stories

### Team Cost Sharing

As an Engineering Team Lead, I want to configure my team's AWSCostMonitor instances to share cost data from a central cache, so that multiple team members can view cost data without each making separate API calls to AWS Cost Explorer.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Team lead configures S3 bucket or shared cache location
2. Each team member opts their profiles into the team cache
3. When cost data is needed, app checks remote cache first before calling AWS API
4. Fresh data is shared back to cache for other team members
5. Team saves money on API calls while maintaining up-to-date cost visibility

### Selective Profile Sharing

As a DevOps Engineer managing multiple AWS accounts, I want to configure which profiles participate in team caching while keeping personal or client profiles private, so that I can share company account data with teammates while maintaining privacy for other accounts.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User accesses profile settings for each AWS profile
2. Toggles "Enable Team Cache" option per profile
3. Profiles with team caching enabled share data to/from remote cache
4. Private profiles continue to use only local caching
5. Clear visibility into which profiles are sharing data

### Fallback and Reliability

As a Solo Developer using team caching, I want the app to gracefully handle remote cache unavailability by falling back to direct AWS API calls, so that I never lose access to cost data due to cache infrastructure issues.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. App attempts to fetch from remote cache first
2. If cache is unavailable or data is stale, falls back to AWS API
3. Continues normal operation with local caching only
4. Automatically retries remote cache on next refresh
5. User sees clear indicators of cache status and fallback behavior

## Spec Scope

1. **S3-Based Cache Storage** - Use AWS S3 as the remote cache backend with IAM-based access control
2. **Per-Profile Team Cache Configuration** - Toggle team caching on/off for each AWS profile individually
3. **Cache-First Data Retrieval** - Check remote cache before making AWS Cost Explorer API calls
4. **Intelligent Cache Sharing** - Upload fresh data to cache when retrieved from AWS API
5. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Gracefully handle cache unavailability with local-only operation
6. **Team Documentation** - Comprehensive setup and usage guide for teams
7. **Marketing Materials** - Website updates and marketing package for the feature

## Out of Scope

- Custom cache server implementation (will use AWS S3)
- Real-time synchronization or websockets
- User authentication beyond AWS IAM
- Cache data encryption beyond AWS S3's built-in encryption
- Support for non-AWS cache backends in initial implementation
- Automatic team discovery or invitation systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Team members can share cost data** - Multiple users can benefit from shared AWS Cost Explorer data without duplicate API calls
2. **Configurable per-profile participation** - Users can selectively enable team caching for specific AWS profiles while keeping others private
3. **Robust fallback behavior** - App continues to function normally when remote cache is unavailable, falling back to direct AWS API calls
