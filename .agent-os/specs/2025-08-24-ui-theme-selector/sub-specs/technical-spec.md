# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-24-ui-theme-selector/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Theme Definition Structure
- Define themes as Swift structs conforming to a `Theme` protocol
- Each theme contains color definitions for primary, secondary, accent, background, and text colors
- Include text formatting properties: font sizes (small, regular, large), font weights  
- Include layout density properties: padding scales, spacing multipliers
- Store theme definitions in a `ThemeManager` singleton

### Theme Application System
- Create `@EnvironmentObject` for theme propagation through SwiftUI view hierarchy
- Implement theme-aware color extensions returning appropriate colors based on active theme
- Add theme-aware modifiers for text formatting and spacing
- Update existing views to use theme colors instead of hardcoded or system colors

### Settings UI Implementation  
- Add new "Appearance" tab in Settings window
- Display theme grid with visual previews showing actual UI components
- Implement live preview updating as user hovers over theme options
- Include toggle for "Sync with System Appearance" option
- Show theme details: name, description, contrast level indicator

### System Appearance Integration
- Monitor `NSApplication.shared.effectiveAppearance` for system theme changes
- Map system appearances to appropriate app themes when sync enabled
- Provide default light/dark theme mappings for each pre-defined theme
- Allow manual override when sync is disabled

### Pre-defined Themes

1. **Classic** - Default macOS system colors, standard text sizes, regular density
2. **Modern** - Contemporary flat design with vibrant accent colors, clean typography
3. **High Contrast** - WCAG AAA compliant contrast ratios, bold text, increased spacing
4. **Compact** - Reduced padding and margins, smaller text, information-dense layout
5. **Comfortable** - Increased whitespace, larger text, relaxed spacing
6. **Terminal** - Dark background with green/amber text, monospace fonts, minimal chrome
7. **Professional** - Muted business colors, serif fonts for headers, formal appearance

### Performance Considerations
- Cache theme colors to avoid repeated computations
- Use `@StateObject` for theme manager to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Apply themes without requiring app restart
- Minimal memory footprint for theme storage

### Persistence Implementation
- Store selected theme identifier in UserDefaults with key "selectedTheme"
- Store system sync preference with key "syncWithSystemAppearance"  
- Load and apply saved theme on app launch
- Migrate existing users to "Classic" theme on first launch after update

## Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. Create theme system foundation with protocols and base themes
2. Implement ThemeManager for state management and persistence
3. Add environment object integration to existing views
4. Build Settings UI with theme preview functionality
5. Integrate system appearance monitoring
6. Test theme switching and persistence across app restarts

### Code Organization
- `Theme/` directory containing all theme-related code
- `Theme/Models/` for theme definitions and protocols
- `Theme/Managers/` for ThemeManager singleton
- `Theme/Views/` for appearance settings UI components
- `Theme/Extensions/` for theme-aware SwiftUI extensions

### Migration Strategy
- Existing users will default to "Classic" theme maintaining current appearance
- No breaking changes to existing UI code during incremental rollout
- Gradual conversion of views to use theme-aware components

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required for this feature. The implementation will use native SwiftUI and AppKit APIs already available in the project.
