> Spec: UI Theme Selector
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a theme selection system that allows users to choose from pre-defined themes affecting color schemes, text formatting, and layout density across the menubar display and main application UI. This feature will enhance user experience by providing visual customization options that adapt to different preferences and accessibility needs while maintaining the app's native macOS feel.

## User Stories

### Theme Customization for Visual Preference

As a developer who spends long hours monitoring AWS costs, I want to select different UI themes, so that I can reduce eye strain and match my development environment aesthetics.

Users will access theme settings through the preferences window, browse available pre-defined themes with live preview, and select a theme that affects the menu bar display, dropdown menus, and calendar visualizations. The selected theme persists across app restarts and can optionally sync with the system's light/dark mode preference.

### Accessibility-Focused Theme Selection  

As a user with visual accessibility needs, I want to choose high-contrast or larger-text themes, so that I can better read cost information at a glance.

Users requiring enhanced visibility can select themes with higher contrast ratios, larger text sizes, or increased spacing. These themes ensure critical cost information remains easily readable in the menu bar and detailed views, improving the app's accessibility without requiring system-wide accessibility settings.

## Spec Scope

1. **Theme Selection Interface** - Settings panel with theme picker showing preview of each theme's appearance
2. **Pre-defined Theme Set** - Collection of 5-7 professionally designed themes covering different visual preferences
3. **Theme Application System** - Apply selected theme to menu bar, dropdown menus, and calendar visualizations
4. **System Appearance Sync** - Optional automatic theme switching based on macOS light/dark mode
5. **Theme Persistence** - Save theme selection globally across all profiles and app restarts

## Out of Scope

- User-created custom themes or theme editor
- Per-profile theme settings
- Quick theme switcher in main menu
- Theme import/export functionality
- Icon style variations
- Animation or transition customizations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working theme selector in Settings window with live preview showing actual UI elements
2. Visible theme changes applied immediately to menu bar display, dropdown menus, and calendar view
3. Theme preference persisted and restored correctly after app restart with system appearance sync option
