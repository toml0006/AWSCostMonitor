## 2025-08-02: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Build AWSCostMonitor as a native macOS menu bar application focused on providing always-visible AWS cost monitoring with minimal resource usage and maximum privacy. Target individual developers and small teams who need simple, effective cost visibility without enterprise complexity.

### Context

AWS cost management tools are typically web-based, require constant login, and don't provide ambient awareness of spending. Developers managing multiple AWS accounts need a lightweight, native solution that respects their workflow and privacy while preventing bill shock.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Web Dashboard**
   - Pros: Cross-platform, rich visualizations, easier to build
   - Cons: Requires constant login, not ambient, privacy concerns

2. **Electron App**
   - Pros: Cross-platform with single codebase, web technologies
   - Cons: High resource usage, not truly native, slower performance

3. **CLI Tool**
   - Pros: Lightweight, scriptable, no GUI overhead
   - Cons: Not ambient, requires manual checking, poor discoverability

### Rationale

Native macOS development with SwiftUI provides the best user experience for our target audience while maintaining minimal resource usage. Menu bar placement ensures ambient awareness without screen real estate consumption.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Instant access without authentication friction
- Minimal resource usage
- Complete data privacy (no backend needed)
- Native macOS experience and integration

**Negative:**
- Limited to macOS platform initially
- Requires Swift/SwiftUI expertise
- Manual distribution without App Store

## 2025-08-02: API Safety as Core Principle

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Users

### Decision

Implement strict API rate limiting with a hard maximum of one AWS API request per minute per profile, with an emergency escape hatch for users to disable the app if it misbehaves.

### Context

AWS API calls have associated costs and rate limits. A runaway process making excessive API calls could result in unexpected charges or API throttling, damaging user trust and potentially costing real money.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **No Rate Limiting**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, real-time updates
   - Cons: Risk of excessive API calls and costs

2. **User-Configurable Rates**
   - Pros: Flexibility for power users
   - Cons: Risk of misconfiguration, complexity

### Rationale

A hard rate limit protects users from both cost overruns and API throttling while still providing timely updates. The escape hatch ensures users maintain control even if something goes wrong.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Guaranteed protection against excessive API usage
- Predictable costs for users
- Builds user trust

**Negative:**
- Less real-time data during rapid cost changes
- Additional complexity in refresh logic

## 2025-08-02: Privacy-First Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Users, Security-conscious developers

### Decision

All data remains local on the user's machine with no external services, telemetry, or analytics. Use only the existing AWS credentials from the system configuration.

### Context

Developers are increasingly concerned about data privacy and security. Many existing solutions require creating accounts, uploading credentials, or sending data to third-party services.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Cloud Backend**
   - Pros: Multi-device sync, advanced analytics, easier updates
   - Cons: Privacy concerns, infrastructure costs, security risks

2. **Optional Analytics**
   - Pros: Usage insights, crash reporting, feature prioritization
   - Cons: Privacy concerns, implementation complexity

### Rationale

A completely local solution eliminates privacy concerns and security risks while simplifying the architecture. Users already trust their local AWS configuration.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero privacy concerns
- No infrastructure costs
- Simplified security model
- Faster performance (no network calls except to AWS)

**Negative:**
- No multi-device sync
- No usage analytics for product improvement
- Manual update distribution

## 2025-08-02: Testing and Documentation Standards

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Future Contributors

### Decision

Prioritize comprehensive testing and documentation throughout development, with unit tests for all business logic and detailed documentation for all features.

### Context

The team values code quality, maintainability, and user understanding. Well-tested and documented code reduces bugs and support burden.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Minimal Testing**
   - Pros: Faster initial development
   - Cons: More bugs, harder maintenance

2. **Documentation on Demand**
   - Pros: Less upfront work
   - Cons: Poor user experience, more support requests

### Rationale

Investing in testing and documentation upfront reduces long-term maintenance costs and improves user satisfaction.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Higher code quality
- Easier onboarding for contributors
- Better user experience
- Reduced support burden

**Negative:**
- Slower initial development
- More upfront effort required
