# Fastlane Setup Status

## âœ… Completed

- **Fastlane Installation**: Fully configured with Gemfile and dependencies
- **API Key Authentication**: Working with App Store Connect API
- **Environment Configuration**: All credentials properly configured in `.env`
- **Lane Configuration**: Complete setup for all App Store operations

Once the app is created on App Store Connect, these commands are ready:

```bash
# Test metadata upload (without app binary)
bundle exec fastlane mac upload_metadata

# Build and upload to TestFlight for beta testing
bundle exec fastlane mac beta

# Full release build and upload to App Store
bundle exec fastlane mac release

# Submit for App Store review
bundle exec fastlane mac submit_for_review
```
