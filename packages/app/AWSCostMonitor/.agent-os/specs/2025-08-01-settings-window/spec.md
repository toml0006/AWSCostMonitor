# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Settings Window
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a proper macOS preferences window using SwiftUI's Settings scene that provides a centralized location for configuring all app settings including display format, refresh intervals, and other preferences. This will replace the current embedded settings controls in the menu bar popup with a native macOS settings experience.

## User Stories

### Settings Access Story

As a macOS user, I want to access app preferences through a dedicated Settings window (⌘,), so that I can configure the app using familiar macOS patterns and have more space for comprehensive settings options.

The user will be able to open settings via the standard keyboard shortcut (⌘,), through a "Settings..." menu item in the menu bar popup, or through the main menu bar when the app has focus. The settings window will provide a clean, organized interface for all configuration options.

### Configuration Management Story

As an AWS cost monitoring user, I want to configure display preferences, refresh intervals, and AWS profile settings in an organized settings interface, so that I can customize the app behavior without cluttering the main menu bar popup.

The settings window will organize related settings into logical groups and provide immediate preview of changes where applicable (like display format).

## Spec Scope

1. **Settings Scene Integration** - Add SwiftUI Settings scene to the app with proper macOS integration
2. **Display Format Settings** - Move existing display format controls to a dedicated settings section with live preview
3. **Refresh Interval Configuration** - Add new setting to control how frequently cost data is refreshed automatically
4. **AWS Profile Management** - Enhanced profile selection and configuration in settings
5. **Settings Menu Integration** - Add "Settings..." option to menu bar popup and keyboard shortcut support

## Out of Scope

- Advanced AWS credential management (beyond profile selection)
- Cost alerting or notification settings
- Historical data visualization settings
- Export or data management features

## Expected Deliverable

1. A native macOS Settings window accessible via ⌘, keyboard shortcut
2. Clean migration of existing display format settings with enhanced preview functionality
3. New refresh interval setting that automatically updates cost data at user-defined intervals
4. "Settings..." menu item in the existing menu bar popup that opens the settings window
