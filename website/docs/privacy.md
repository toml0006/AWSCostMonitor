## How AWSCostMonitor Works

### Local-Only Architecture

AWSCostMonitor operates entirely on your local machine:

- **No telemetry** - We don't track usage or collect analytics
- **No phone home** - The app never contacts our servers (we don't have any!)
- **No accounts** - No registration or sign-up required
- **No ads** - No advertising or tracking mechanisms

### AWS Credentials Management

Your AWS credentials are sacred to us:

- Read from your existing AWS CLI configuration (`~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`)
- Never transmitted to us or any third party
- Used only for direct API calls from your Mac to AWS
- Managed by macOS's secure system configuration

### Data Flow

```
Your Mac ‚Üí AWS Cost Explorer API
    ‚Üì
Cost Data
    ‚Üì
Display in Menu Bar
```

That's it. No detours through our servers. No middleman. Just direct, secure communication.

## Optional Team Cache Feature

If you choose to enable Team Cache:

- Data is stored in **your own AWS S3 bucket**
- You specify the bucket and control access
- Only team members with access to that bucket can share data
- We have no visibility into this data
- Everything stays within your AWS infrastructure

## What We Don't Do

- ‚ùå No user tracking
- ‚ùå No usage analytics
- ‚ùå No error reporting to us
- ‚ùå No crash analytics
- ‚ùå No behavioral data
- ‚ùå No marketing data
- ‚ùå No data selling
- ‚ùå No third-party sharing

## Data Storage

### On Your Mac
- User preferences: Stored in macOS UserDefaults
- Cache: Temporary cost data in memory only
- All data deleted when app is uninstalled

### Not in the Cloud
- We don't operate any servers
- We don't have a backend
- We can't access your data even if we wanted to

## Third-Party Services

### AWS Services
When you use AWSCostMonitor, you're connecting directly to AWS:
- Governed by [AWS Privacy Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/)
- Standard AWS API rate limits and costs apply
- AWS may log API calls per their policies

### Mac App Store (If Applicable)
If you download from the Mac App Store:
- Apple's standard terms apply
- In-app purchases processed by Apple
- We receive no personal information from transactions

## Security Measures

- ‚úÖ HTTPS encryption for all AWS API calls
- ‚úÖ macOS Keychain integration for credential security
- ‚úÖ Sandboxed application (App Store version)
- ‚úÖ No network listeners or servers
- ‚úÖ Regular security updates

## Your Rights and Control

Since we don't collect data, you have complete control:

- **Access**: All your data is already on your machine
- **Deletion**: Uninstall the app to remove everything
- **Portability**: Your AWS data belongs to you
- **Correction**: Manage your preferences directly in the app
- **Opt-out**: Simply don't use features you don't want

## Privacy Promise

We built AWSCostMonitor because we wanted a tool that respects privacy. That's why:

1. **No venture capital** = No pressure to monetize your data
2. **No data collection** = Nothing to leak or breach
3. **Open source** = Complete transparency
4. **Local only** = Your data never leaves your Mac

  <p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Your AWS cost data is yours alone. We can't see it, we don't want to see it, and we've built AWSCostMonitor to ensure it stays that way.</p>
