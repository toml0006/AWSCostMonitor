## Version 1.3.0 - "The One Where We Actually Charge Money" 
*Released August 12, 2025*

**Oh, you thought everything would stay free forever? How adorable.** 

### üíé New Pro Features (Yes, We Said Pro)
- **Team Cache Sharing** - Finally, a way for your teammates to stop hitting the AWS API like it's a pi√±ata. Share cost data via S3 because apparently coordination is hard.
- **Advanced Forecasting** - Crystal ball not included, but our algorithms will tell you how broke you'll be by month-end with disturbing accuracy.
- **3-Day Free Trial** - We're not monsters. Try before you cry about the price.
- **One-time $3.99 Purchase** - That's less than your overpriced coffee habit. No subscriptions because we're not *that* evil.

### ‚ö° Improvements (AKA "Things That Should Have Worked Better")
- **Enhanced Calendar View** - Now with 47% more colors and 73% fewer "what does this blob mean?" moments
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Press ‚åò1-9 to switch profiles because apparently clicking is *so* last year
- **Optimized API Usage** - We made it even more efficient so you can save those precious AWS pennies for important things like... more AWS services
- **Better Error Handling** - Now when things break, we'll tell you about it in a slightly nicer way

### üêõ Bug Fixes (AKA "Oops, Our Bad")
- Fixed memory leak that was slowly eating your RAM like a digital Pac-Man
- Resolved profile switching delays because waiting 3 seconds is apparently the end of the world
- Fixed chart rendering on external displays (yes, we know you have that fancy 4K monitor)
- Improved AWS credential parsing because apparently reading files is *complicated*

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Stuff You Probably Don't Care About
- Universal binary support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- Complete App Store integration with all the fancy metadata
- StoreKit configuration because in-app purchases are apparently rocket science
- Privacy policy because lawyers exist

## Version 1.2.0 - "The One With Pretty Pictures"
*Released July 15, 2025*

**We heard you like looking at things, so we put charts in your charts.**

- **Donut Charts** - Because pie charts are for quitters and donuts are delicious
- **Day Detail Views** - Click any day to see exactly how you spent your cloud allowance
- **Memphis Design Aesthetic** - It's the 80s, but make it expensive

### ‚å®Ô∏è Power User Features
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - ‚åòK for calendar because we're not savages
- **Profile Quick-switching** - For when you manage more AWS accounts than you have brain cells
- **Hover Effects** - Because static charts are for static people

### üîß Under the Hood
- MVC architecture refactoring (because apparently organization matters)
- Debug timer controls (for when you want to pretend you're debugging)

**Pro Tip**: If you're still using the free version after trying the Pro trial, that's fine. We get it. But remember, every time you manually check the AWS console instead of using our calendar view, a developer somewhere sheds a single tear.
