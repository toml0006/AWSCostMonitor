# Team Cache Security Best Practices

## Overview

The AWSCostMonitor Team Cache feature allows teams to share AWS cost data through a secure S3-based cache. This document outlines security best practices, implementation details, and compliance considerations.

## Security Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only get the minimum permissions necessary
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Data Privacy**: Sensitive cost data is protected at rest and in transit
4. **Audit Trail**: All cache operations are logged for compliance

### Authentication & Authorization

The team cache leverages existing AWS IAM credentials, requiring no additional secrets:

- **Authentication**: AWS IAM credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`
- **Authorization**: IAM policies control S3 bucket access
- **No Additional Secrets**: Uses existing AWS credential chain

## IAM Permission Requirements

### Minimum Required Permissions

For full team cache functionality, users need:

```json
{
  "s3:GetObject",      // Read cached data
  "s3:PutObject",      // Write new cache entries
  "s3:DeleteObject",   // Clear expired cache
  "s3:HeadObject",     // Check cache existence
  "s3:ListBucket",     // List cache entries
  "s3:HeadBucket"      // Test connectivity
}
```

### Permission Validation

AWSCostMonitor validates permissions before enabling team cache:

1. Tests S3 bucket connectivity with `HeadBucket`
2. Validates read/write permissions with test objects
3. Provides clear error messages for missing permissions
4. Gracefully falls back to local-only mode on permission errors

## Encryption Options

### Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3)

Default encryption using AWS-managed keys:

```swift
// Automatically enabled in S3CacheService
serverSideEncryption: .aes256
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero configuration required
- No key management overhead
- Automatic encryption/decryption

### AWS KMS Encryption (SSE-KMS)

Enhanced encryption using customer-managed KMS keys:

```swift
// Configure in TeamCacheConfig
encryptionType: .kms
kmsKeyId: "arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/id"
```

**Benefits:**
- Full control over encryption keys
- Key rotation policies
- Detailed audit logs via CloudTrail
- Cross-account key sharing

### Client-Side Encryption (Future)

Optional client-side encryption before S3 upload:

```swift
// Not yet implemented
clientSideEncryption: true
encryptionKey: "local-key"
```

## Access Control

### Bucket Policies

Enforce security requirements at the bucket level:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyInsecureTransport",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "RequireEncryption",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
          "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Cross-Account Access

For teams with multiple AWS accounts:

1. Configure bucket policy to allow specific account IDs
2. Use IAM roles for cross-account access
3. Enable MFA for sensitive operations (optional)

## Audit Logging

### S3 Access Logging

All cache operations are logged to a separate audit bucket:

```yaml
LoggingConfiguration:
  DestinationBucketName: team-cache-audit-logs
  LogFilePrefix: team-cache-access/
```

**Logged Information:**
- Timestamp of access
- IAM identity making the request
- Operation performed (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Object key accessed
- Response status

### Application-Level Logging

AWSCostMonitor logs cache operations locally:

```swift
logger.info("Cache operation", [
    "operation": operation,
    "profile": profileName,
    "cacheKey": key,
    "result": result
])
```

### CloudTrail Integration

For compliance requirements, enable CloudTrail:

1. Tracks all S3 API calls
2. Provides immutable audit trail
3. Integrates with SIEM systems
4. Supports compliance reporting

## Data Classification

### Sensitive Data Elements

The following data is stored in the cache:

- **AWS Account IDs**: Considered sensitive
- **Cost Data**: Monthly and daily spending amounts
- **Service Usage**: Breakdown by AWS service
- **Profile Names**: May contain organizational information

### Data Retention

- **Cache TTL**: 15-60 minutes (configurable)
- **S3 Lifecycle**: Automatic deletion after 30 days
- **Audit Logs**: Retained for 90 days

## Network Security

### TLS/HTTPS Only

All S3 communications use TLS 1.2+:

```swift
// Enforced by AWS SDK
transport: .https
minimumTLSVersion: .v1_2
```

### VPC Endpoints (Optional)

For enhanced network security:

1. Create S3 VPC endpoint in your VPC
2. Route traffic privately without internet gateway
3. Apply endpoint policies for additional control

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance

- **Data Minimization**: Only cache necessary cost data
- **Right to Erasure**: Cache auto-expires, manual deletion available
- **Data Portability**: Export functionality provided
- **Audit Trail**: Full logging of data access

### SOC 2 Compliance

- **Access Controls**: IAM-based authentication
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit logging
- **Incident Response**: Clear error handling and alerting

### HIPAA Compliance

While cost data is not PHI, if used in HIPAA environments:

1. Enable AWS KMS encryption with customer-managed keys
2. Sign BAA with AWS for S3 service
3. Enable CloudTrail logging
4. Implement access reviews

## Security Checklist

Before enabling team cache, verify:

- [ ] S3 bucket has encryption enabled
- [ ] Bucket policy enforces HTTPS
- [ ] IAM policies follow least privilege
- [ ] Access logging is configured
- [ ] Lifecycle policies are set
- [ ] Public access is blocked
- [ ] Versioning is enabled (recommended)
- [ ] MFA delete is enabled (for production)
- [ ] CloudTrail is configured (for compliance)
- [ ] Regular security reviews scheduled

## Incident Response

### Potential Security Events

1. **Unauthorized Access Attempt**
   - Detection: Access denied errors in logs
   - Response: Review IAM policies and bucket ACLs

2. **Data Exfiltration**
   - Detection: Unusual GET request patterns
   - Response: Review access logs, rotate credentials

3. **Cache Poisoning**
   - Detection: Unexpected cache data format
   - Response: Clear cache, validate data sources

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Disable team cache in affected profiles
   - Rotate compromised credentials
   - Review audit logs

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze S3 access logs
   - Review CloudTrail events
   - Check for configuration changes

3. **Remediation**
   - Update IAM policies
   - Patch any vulnerabilities
   - Document lessons learned
